      Overview
            Texas Hold'em is a community card poker game, with game play focused as much on the betting as on the cards
            being played.
            Although the rules and game play remain mostly the same, the end goal is slightly different depending on if
             you're playing a cash game or a tournament.
            A Hold'em tournament is the same as any other game of Hold'em with a few added rules and twists. If you'd
            like to learn the rules unique to tournaments, head to this article. (There will also be a link at the
            bottom of the page).
            Texas Holdem is played on a single table with two to 10 players. The goal is simple: win as many chips as
            you can, one pot at a time.
            You win a pot by having the best hand, or by having all other players fold before the showdown.
            The structure of Texas Hold'em can be broken up into three main divisions:
                    - Setup
                    - Betting Rounds
                    - Showdown
